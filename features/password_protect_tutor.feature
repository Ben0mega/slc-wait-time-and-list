Feature: password protect data for tutor
  As a tutor
  So that no random user can see the queue data
  I want the queue data to be password protected

  Scenario: Sign in happy path
    Given I'm on the sign in page
    When I fill in the password correctly
    And I should be on student queues page


  Scenario: Sign in sad path
    Given I'm on the student sign in page
    When I fill in the password incorrectly
    Then I should be on the student sign in page
    And I should be told that the password is incorrect
